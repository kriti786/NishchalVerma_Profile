<p>
  Intelligent Data Engineering and Automation (IDEA) Laboratory is a part of Department of Electrical Engineering at Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur,
  India and is led by Prof. Nishchal K. Verma. Research at IDEA Lab mainly focuses on Computational Intelligence, Fuzzy Systems Modelling & Control,
   Condition Based Monitoring of UAVs, UGVs and Rotating Machines, Industrial Automation, Big Data Analysis, Deep Learning of Neural and Fuzzy Networks,
    Machine Learning Algorithms, Computer Vision and Image Processing, Brain Computer/ Machine Interface, Intelligent Informatics, Soft-Computing in Modelling
    and Control, Internet of Things/ Cyber Physical Systems, Cognitive Science and Intelligent Fault Diagnosis Systems, and Prognosis and Health Management.

The primary goal of the lab is to develop technologies and tools which address the various complex and challenging problems affecting the real-world especially
where traditional approaches are not effective. On the theoretical front, the emphasis is on finding algorithms for the central tasks in data
mining and computer vision, such as dimensionality reduction, clustering and classification algorithms.

In parallel to theoretical research, new applications like Smartphone based Intelligent Condition Based Monitoring System, Sensitive Position Finder, Future Image
Frame Generator using smart computing devices i.e. Smartphone, palmtop, Vision based Inventory Management System, Automated Guided Vehicle,
 Deep Learning Strategies in BioInformatics, Image Classification and Condition Based Monitoring are being developed. This lab also facilitates the BCI lab where we have
 the emotiv epoc, a 14-channel high-resolution wireless EEG system for conducting various experiments on real time EEG signals. Apart from this, Transducers and Instrumentation Virtual Laboratory has been setup for UG students for conducting experiments online and offline to better understand the working of various transducers and related instruments.

  IEEE Computational Intelligence Society is a professional society of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) focusing on "the theory, design, application, and development of biologically and linguistically motivated computational paradigms emphasizing neural networks, connectionist systems, genetic algorithms, evolutionary programming, fuzzy systems, and hybrid intelligent systems in which these paradigms are contained". IEEE, an association dedicated to advancing innovation and technological excellence for the benefit of humanity, is the world's largest technical professional society. It is designed to serve professionals involved in all aspects of the electrical, electronic, and computing fields and related areas of science and technology that underlie modern civilization.
  IEEE's roots go back to 1884 when electricity began to become a major influence in the society. There was one major established electrical industry, the telegraph, which since the 1840s had come to connect the world with a data communications system faster than the speed of transportation. The telephone, electric power and light industries had just gotten underway. IEEE, pronounced "Eye-triple-E," stands for the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers. The association is chartered under this name and it is the full legal name.
  However, as the world's largest technical professional association, IEEE's membership has long been composed of engineers, scientists, and allied professionals. These include computer scientists, software developers, information technology professionals, physicists, medical doctors, and many others in addition to IEEE's electrical and electronics engineering core. For this reason the organization no longer goes by the full name, except on legal business documents, and is referred to simply as IEEE.
